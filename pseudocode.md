Pseudocode - Core
======

**1.** Create an array that stores each letter with a value, for example: a, e, i, o u: 1

**2.** Create a function that allows a string input

**3.** If the input isn't a string return 0, can use if statement or || 0

**4.** Split the string into indivdual characters and force every instance to be lowercase

**5.** Use a forEach to reassign the characters based on the values array, return 0 if a character isn't a letter for example: '@'

**6.** Total the values and return said total

Pseudocode - Extensions
------

**1.** Before the letters are split - before step 4 in core - check if there's brackets - be it {} or [] - within the string

**2.** Store the letters that were within the brackets as a separate array

**3.** Multiply the separated letter's values by 2/3 before adding them to the total, and returning the total once both the original and core values are totaled

**4.** ~~In the case of the second extension, I believe that the same method as above should work too.~~
